# QuantumDynamicInconsistencyModels.jl

This package contains code for a quantum cognition model of dynamic inconsistency in two-stage decision tasks. 

# Installation

This package is not registered in Julia's general registry. However, there two ways you can install the package. Option 1 is to install without version control. In the REPL, use `]` to switch to the package mode and enter the following:

```julia
add https://github.com/itsdfish/QuantumDynamicInconsistencyModels.jl
```
Option 2 is to install via a custom registry. The advantage of this approach is that you have more control over version control, expecially if you are using a project-specfic environment. 

1. Install the registry using the directions found [here](https://github.com/itsdfish/Registry.jl).
2. Add the package by typing `]` into the REPL and then typing (or pasting):

```julia
add QuantumDynamicInconsistencyModels
```
